Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because the modules **sale_elaboration** and
**stock_customer_deposit** create a compute method for the order line
*route_id* field.

As odoo does not have a compute core method for this field, it cannot be
inherited so if you install both modules, one method will be overwritten
and one behaviour will be lost.
