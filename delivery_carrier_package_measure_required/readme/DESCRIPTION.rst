This module adds the possibility to flag some measurements on package to be required for delivery.

It depends on the `stock_quant_package_dimension` which adds more dimensions on packages.

The required measurement can be flagged on the product packaging.

Then the dimension can be set on the wizard displayed by the Put In Pack button.

A check is also done on transfer validation, to ensure that the required measurements are set.
