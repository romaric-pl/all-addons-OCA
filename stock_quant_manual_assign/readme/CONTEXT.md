BUSINESS NEED: 
In logistics operations, it can be crucial to manually select specific batches or product units for transfer, especially when handling products with different expiration dates, lots, or serial numbers. This level of control ensures that inventory management is accurate and compliant with quality and traceability requirements.
This module is useful when some of the following cases occur:
* You work with multiple locations and you want to indicate from which specific location you want to reserve the product.
* You are working with lot or serial numbers and want to indicate a specific tracking number for the reservation.

APPROACH: The module addresses this need by providing a tool that allows the selection and assignment of specific quants directly from each picking. This is achieved through a wizard that facilitates the manual selection of the product quantities to be moved, thereby enhancing flexibility and accuracy in inventory management.
