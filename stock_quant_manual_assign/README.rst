This module allows you to make stock reservations manually in a
transfer, changing the selection that Odoo automatically made.This
functionality is essential for detailed and specific control over
inventory transfers, ensuring that the correct products are moved
between precise locations within the warehouse.

Use Cases / Context
===================

BUSINESS NEED: In logistics operations, it can be crucial to manually
select specific batches or product units for transfer, especially when
handling products with different expiration dates, lots, or serial
numbers. This level of control ensures that inventory management is
accurate and compliant with quality and traceability requirements. This
module is useful when some of the following cases occur:

-  You work with multiple locations and you want to indicate from which
   specific location you want to reserve the product.
-  You are working with lot or serial numbers and want to indicate a
   specific tracking number for the reservation.

APPROACH: The module addresses this need by providing a tool that allows
the selection and assignment of specific quants directly from each
picking. This is achieved through a wizard that facilitates the manual
selection of the product quantities to be moved, thereby enhancing
flexibility and accuracy in inventory management.

USEFUL INFORMATION: N/A

Usage
=====

Once a planned transfer has been confirmed (manually, or with the
confirmation of a sales order, for example), in order to validate it, it
is first necessary to perform the "check availability" action. By
selecting "check availability", Odoo automatically checks the quantities
in stock necessary to cover the picking demand and reserves the products
to prevent them from being used in other movements.

In order to manually select the quant we want to assign to the transfer,
we have to:

1. Click on the label icon at the end of each move as shown below.

|alt text|

This will show us a wizard like the following:

|image1|

In the form we can see the following information:

-  Lot: The lot/serial number of the products we have on hand. If the
   selected product does not have traceability, it will appear empty.
-  Location: Shows the current location in which the product is in
   stock.
-  On Hand: Quantity on hand in each location and the corresponding
   lot/serial numbers.
-  Other Reserved: Quantity already reserved for another picking.
-  Select: If checked, it allows us to indicate that we are going to
   reserve products from that specific lot and location.
-  Qty: Quantity to be reserved for the current picking.
-  Remaining qty (located at the bottom left): Indicates the quantity
   that could not be reserved due to a lack of available stock.

2. Modify the quantity column and check the Select column, in order to
   define the locations and lot/serial numbers that we need to transfer.

3. Click the confirm button in the wizard. With that, the reserved
   quantity will be set/changed to follow the manual assignment. It can
   be checked in the detailed operations of the movement.
