For barcode rule setup, please refer to readme of barcodes_generator_product.

In user, enable boolean "Generate Barcodes".

In each product template related to a variant without a set barcode, a button "manage missing barcodes" will appear (or: if all variants of a product template have a barcode set, this button will not appear in product template).


Clicking the button opens a wizard displaying all variants without a barcode set. Selecting a barcode rule and clicking "Apply rule and generate barcodes" will assign a base and a barcode to each variant.


In barcode rule, a new boolean "Is Default Barcode Rule" allows the rule to be automatically selected when opening the wizard.
