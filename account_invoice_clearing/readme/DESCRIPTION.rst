This module complements the functionality of *Automatic Entries* in Accounting.
It provides a Wizard to clear invoices by creating an intermediate journal entry.
It allows to clear any invoice with its opposite types. *out_* types are cleared with *in_* types and vice versa.
The invoices to be cleared have to be not paid or partially paid.
The wizard will use the residual amount of the invoices in the clearing process.
