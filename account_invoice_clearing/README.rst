This module complements the functionality of *Automatic Entries* in Accounting.
It provides a Wizard to clear invoices by creating an intermediate journal entry.
It allows to clear any invoice with its opposite types. *out_* types are cleared with *in_* types and vice versa.
The invoices to be cleared have to be not paid or partially paid.
The wizard will use the residual amount of the invoices in the clearing process.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

#. Go to a view where invoices are shown. No matter if are Invoices or Bills.
#. Select one or several invoices/bills. You can also enter an invoice/bill and click on the *Invoice clearing* button if it's open and fully paid.
#. Fill in the top fields of the wizard and in the lines to clear field, select the lines from other invoices you want to clear.
#. With the Sort buttons, you can sort the lines as appropriate.
#. With the actions button, you can reset, clear or autofill the amount to be used in the order previously chosen.
#. Check that the preview is as expected.
#. Press the Confirm button to create the invoice clearing.
