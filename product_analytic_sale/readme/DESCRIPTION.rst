This module is a glue module between the modules **product_analytic** and **sale**.

The module **product_analytic** inherits the *create()* method of account.move.line to add the Analytic Account depending on the Product. But it is not enough in some specific scenarios: for exemple, if you have *Analytic Policy* set to *Required* on Revenue accounts and you have a sale tax configured with a revenue account and with the option *Include in Analytic Cost* enabled, then Odoo will not allow to create the invoice from a sale order. This module solves this issue by inheriting the method *_prepare_invoice_line()* of the sale order line.
