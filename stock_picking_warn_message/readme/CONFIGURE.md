To use this module, configure warnings on the partners for which you want to set warnings.

Before setting warnings, ensure user access is configured:

1. **Global Warning Configuration:**
   - Enable the Warnings setting under Settings > Inventory > Operations > Warnings.
   - This allows all users in the system to assign warning messages, which will be displayed in transfers.

2. **Partner-Specific Warning Configuration:**
   - This method doesn't require enabling the Warning setting.
   - The user has the needed group: A warning can be set on a partner (Stock)

Once configured, with a user account having access to set warnings on partners:

- Navigate to the partner configuration form.
- In "Internal Notes" find the option "Warning on the Picking."
- Choose "Warning" or "Blocking Message."
- Type your message in the designated field.
