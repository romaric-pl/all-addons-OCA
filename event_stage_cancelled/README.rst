This module adds the posibility of flagging an event stage as cancelled
so we can hook workflows onto it like cancelling registrations or
scheduling special mail events.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Up to v14, events had an state field instead of configurable stages. A
lost feature with that change was the concept of a cancelled event and
with it the logic associated to it: when we cancelled an event, its
registrations were cancelled along with it.

Configuration
=============

To set a stage as cancelled:

-  Go to *Events > Configuration > Event Stages* and choose the one you
   want to be the cancelled one.

To schedule a mail that triggers when the event is cancelled:

-  Go to *Events* and select an event.
-  Go to the *Communication* tab and add a new scheduler.
-  Choose to trigger it *After the event cancellation*.
-  Choose the other parameters like template or the interval.

When the event is cancelled, the corresponding mail will be sent to the
attendants who where confirmed at the moment of the cancellation.

Usage
=====

When you want to cancel an event an its registration, just click on the
*Cancel Event* button from the event itself.

A confirmation dialog will show up and if you confirm it, the linked
registrations will be cancelled as well.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  If you just change the stage to the cancelled one, the registrations
   won't be cancelled. This is avoided for the moment on purpose as a
   confirmation dialog would require an special ``ir.actions.client``
   implementation.
