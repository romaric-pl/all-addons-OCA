This module extends the *Netherlands BTW Statement* module (BTW aangifte report), by adding the statement for the *Intra-Community transactions declaration* (ICP declaration).

The ICP declaration report is based on line *3b - Leveringen naar landen binnen de EU (omzet)* of the BTW aangifte report.
The period is also the same as the one selected in the BTW aangifte report.

This ICP declaration report includes:

* the VAT identification numbers of your customers;
* the total amount of intra-Community supplies from the Netherlands for every customer during the selected period.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

This module makes use of the tax tags "3b" and "3b diensten".

If the default Odoo Dutch chart of accounts is installed (module ``l10n_nl``) then "3b" tag is automatically present in the database.
In this case you should add the "3b diensten" teg and set it into the tax definition.

If a non-standard chart of accounts is installed, you have to manually create the tax tags and properly set them into the tax definition.
The name of the tags must be formatted this way: "+3b (omzet)", "-3b (omzet)", "+3b diensten (omzet)", "-3b diensten (omzet)".

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Create a BTW Statement: a new tab *ICP Statement* will be displayed; the tab contains the lines of the ICP declaration report.
#. In tab *ICP Statement* press the Update button in order to recompute the ICP statement lines.

Printing a PDF report:

#. If you need to print the report in PDF, open a statement form and click: `Print -> NL ICP Statement`

Multicompany fiscal unit:

#. In case one single tax statement is created for companies belonging to a
   fiscal unit, the sum of the intra-Community supplies and services of all
   the companies will be written down in the totals of that tax statement.
#. After the fiscal unit tax statement is created and posted, for each of the
   companies belonging to a fiscal unit that trades intra-Community, create
   its own ICP report separately.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add checks to avoid errors in the report, e.g. no VAT code, tax-code not matching fiscal position, etc..
