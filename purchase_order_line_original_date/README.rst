This module adds the *Original Delivery Date* to Purchase Order lines. This is
useful for past analysis and vendor performance reports.

In standard Odoo, once a PO is confirmed with delivery dates on its lines, this
dates can still change to reflect changes in the planning (e.g. you receive a
notification from your supplier that goods will arrive a couple of days later).
In such situation you lost precious information of the original delivery dates
that can be used to compute the real delay in the receipt from your supplier.
