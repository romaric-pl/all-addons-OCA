Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because there is no way to know when you can
pay an invoice if has an early discount date.

It will be useful for you if you receive invoices with early discounts.

This module was developed because in Odoo 17 CE exist the Early Discount
Date on Account Move lines.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Accounting > Suppliers > Bills (or Customers > Invoices) and
   set the Discount Date on a desired bill.
2. All Move Lines with maturity date set, will update its Discount Date
   with the Discount Date of the invoice.
3. You can group invoices to know which Invoice should be paid to ensure
   the discount benefit.
4. You can change the Discount Date on any move line. The lower one will
   be set on the bill.

-  When the Discount Date of the bill is changed, the recomputation of
   the Discount Date on the lines will happen.
-  Make sure you only increment the discount date if you have multiple
   maturity dates or the lower Discount Date will be propagated on all
   maturity lines.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This module is no longer necessary in Odoo 17 because Early Discount
   Dates are present on Payment Terms.

-  The name of the field on account.move.line is the same to ensure a
   smooth migration process.
