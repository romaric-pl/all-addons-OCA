To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Accounting > Suppliers > Bills (or Customers > Invoices) and set the Discount Date on a desired bill.
2. All Move Lines with maturity date set, will update its Discount Date with the Discount Date of the invoice.
3. You can group invoices to know which Invoice should be paid to ensure the discount benefit.
4. You can change the Discount Date on any move line. The lower one will be set on the bill.
  - When the Discount Date of the bill is changed, the recomputation of the Discount Date on the lines will happen.
  - Make sure you only increment the discount date if you have multiple maturity dates or the lower Discount Date will be propagated on all maturity lines.
