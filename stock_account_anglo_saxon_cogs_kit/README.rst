The Odoo Official documentation recommends to use consumable for kit products and only to be
storable in case Anglosaxon accounting:

https://www.odoo.com/documentation/16.0/applications/inventory_and_mrp/manufacturing/management/kit_shipping.html

"Although kits should almost always be set to Consumable,
companies using Anglo-Saxon accounting might need to create kits as a Storable Product. This is 
because when processing invoices for kits, the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) will be posted in accounting journals."

However, that forces companies to track quantities for kits, and that is not always desirable. 

With this module companies using Anglo-Saxon accounting don't need to set the kit products to be
storable if they don't want to track quantities for the kit.
