The module allows you to integrate check deposit with agent commissions.

When generating agent commissions, an invoice with checks payment
will be taken into consideration only after the number of days set in
the "Safety Days" field in journal configuration from due date set in
check payment.

   want to create commissions. It should be at least one day after the last

   at least the first day of the following month.
#. You can settle only certain agents if you select them on the "Agents"

    settled properly.
