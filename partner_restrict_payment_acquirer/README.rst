Usage
=====

Open partner form and go to "Sales & Purchases" tab. Add payment acquirers in "Allowed Acquirers" filed.
When partner opens invoice in portal only allowed acquirers will be available for payment.

Note: leaving this field empty will remove any restrictions and allow to select any acquirer.

Known issues / Roadmap

Would be reasonable to create an extension of this module for E-Commerce. Eg "partner_restrict_payment_acquirer_website"
