This app restricts user from creating timesheets for past dates (or changing date of timesheet to a past date) based on project configuration or global restriction settings.

Use case is to make sure that new timesheets are not added to a specific time range after that period has been reported and/or billed.

In user, it's possible to activate flag "No timesheet date restriction" to override behavior.
