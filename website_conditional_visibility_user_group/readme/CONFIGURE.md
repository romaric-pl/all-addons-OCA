To configure the user group visibility:

- With the frontend editor opened select the block you want to set the visibility for.
- In *Style* tab of the editor panel set the *Visibility* option to *Conditional* and
  unfold it.
- Set the *Users* option to *Visible for logged in*.
- Now you'll see the new *Groups* option.
- You can choose between *Only internal users*, *Only portal users* or *No restriction*,
  which is the default value.
