This module allows administrator to configure groups for portal users, which is not possible with standard Odoo.

That's useful for having different types of portal users (think differentiate vendors from customers) and leveraging Odoo's group mechanism for ie views instead having to cook up custom solutions.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

#. now you can use this group in your frontend templates and code to make some features accessible to this group

* allowing to chose portal groups in the portal wizard would be nice
