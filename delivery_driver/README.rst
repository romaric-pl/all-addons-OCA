Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because there is no possibility to assign
drivers in delivery methods or delivery notes. Drivers do not have to be
delivery methods, so it is possible to work with drivers.

This is useful if you want to be able to assign drivers on delivery
notes independently of the delivery method.
