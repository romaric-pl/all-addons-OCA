This module allows to import the CDR data from the Netsapiens backend as Odoo Analytic Lines.


- On Contacts/Phone Rates, import data
- Create a Sales Order, and select a correctly configured Subscription Product.
- Confirm the Sales Order. This will:
    - Assign a new Analytic Account to the SO
    - Create a Subscription with this Analytic Account
    - Create an Agreement with this Analytic Account
- Edit Agreement
    - Add Service Profile
    - On Service Profile, assign Equipment
    - On Equipment, assign Equipment Backend
    - On Equipment Backend, configure connection and Products to import
- On Service Profile, run "Import CDR"


The "Import CDR" will query call records based on
the query configuration in the Service Profile:
the Query Type (User, Domain) and the Query Parameter to use.

To be able to use the generated Analytic Lines for billing,
the ``sale_timesheet`` module needs to be installed,
and the Products generated by the "Import CDR"
should be configured.
