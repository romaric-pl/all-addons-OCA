To use this module you need to:

1.- Generate a stock valuation layer (ex: create a purchase of the product)
2.- Generate another valuation layer that is linked to the first one (This can be done using landed cost)
3.- Now you have on the original valuation the original cost and the updated cost (the one generated on the second valuation)
