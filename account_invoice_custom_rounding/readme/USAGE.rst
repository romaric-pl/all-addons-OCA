To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to the "Other Information" tab in an invoice to select the rounding method in the
"Tax Calculation Rounding Method" field. If no option is selected, the rounding method
set in the company configuration will be applied.
#. If the contact has a value in its "Tax Calculation Rounding Method" field, it will
be set in the invoice when this contact is selected. It is possible to change this
option.
#. The configured rounding method in a contact will be automatically applied to the
invoice and it will be applied when the invoice is created.
#. Note that changes in the rounding method in invoices will be applied once the
invoice is saved.
