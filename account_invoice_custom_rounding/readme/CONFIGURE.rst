To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to a contact and select an option in the field "Tax Calculation Rounding Method".
This option will be selected by default in invoices in which this contact is set as the
customer.
#. In the simplified view of a child contact, the "Tax Calculation Rounding Method"
field is only visible if the child contact is an "Invoice Address".
#. If no option is selected, the rounding method set in the company configuration will
be applied.
#. If a contact has child contacts, these child contacts will not inherit the parent
contact's rounding method.
