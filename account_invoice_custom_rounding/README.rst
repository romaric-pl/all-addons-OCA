Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to a contact and select an option in the field "Tax Calculation Rounding Method".
This option will be selected by default in invoices in which this contact is set as the
customer.
#. In the simplified view of a child contact, the "Tax Calculation Rounding Method"
field is only visible if the child contact is an "Invoice Address".
#. If no option is selected, the rounding method set in the company configuration will
be applied.
#. If a contact has child contacts, these child contacts will not inherit the parent
contact's rounding method.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to the "Other Information" tab in an invoice to select the rounding method in the
"Tax Calculation Rounding Method" field. If no option is selected, the rounding method
set in the company configuration will be applied.
#. If the contact has a value in its "Tax Calculation Rounding Method" field, it will
be set in the invoice when this contact is selected. It is possible to change this
option.
#. The configured rounding method in a contact will be automatically applied to the
invoice and it will be applied when the invoice is created.
#. Note that changes in the rounding method in invoices will be applied once the
invoice is saved.
