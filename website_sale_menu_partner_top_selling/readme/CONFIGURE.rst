The module allows you to configure the number of products to be displayed by means of a
configuration parameter.

Limit settings:

Go to Settings > Website > Products and adjust the value in the corresponding field to
set the maximum number of products to be displayed on the regular products page.
The category panel must also be active in /shop.
