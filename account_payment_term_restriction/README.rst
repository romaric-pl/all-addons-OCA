This module adds the possibility to restrict the use of Payment Terms in Journal
Entries.

By setting a restriction value on the Payment Term, the restrictions applied will be:

  * Sales: This Payment Term can only be set on Invoices / Credit Notes.
  * Purchase: This Payment Term can only be set on Bills / Refunds.
  * All: It can be applied to both Sales and Purchase types.

Configuration
=============

To be able to configure the restriction on Payment Terms you first need to go to the
menu Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Payment Terms.

Once there, opening any Payment Term or creating a new one, there'll be an option where
you can set Sales, Purchase or All. The value will be the restriction applied to
Journal Entries.

You can pass the `skip_payment_term_restriction` context to avoid the checks.
