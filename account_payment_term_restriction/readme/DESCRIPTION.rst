This module adds the possibility to restrict the use of Payment Terms in Journal
Entries.

By setting a restriction value on the Payment Term, the restrictions applied will be:

  * Sales: This Payment Term can only be set on Invoices / Credit Notes.
  * Purchase: This Payment Term can only be set on Bills / Refunds.
  * All: It can be applied to both Sales and Purchase types.
