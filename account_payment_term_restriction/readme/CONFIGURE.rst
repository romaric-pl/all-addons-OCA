To be able to configure the restriction on Payment Terms you first need to go to the
menu Invoicing > Configuration > Management > Payment Terms.

Once there, opening any Payment Term or creating a new one, there'll be an option where
you can set Sales, Purchase or All. The value will be the restriction applied to
Journal Entries.

You can pass the `skip_payment_term_restriction` context to avoid the checks.
