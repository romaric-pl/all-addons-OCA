To use this module, you need to:

1.  Go to *Sales \> Products \> Pricelists* and create a new Price List.
2.  Add a Pricelist Items to that Price List. Set 'Fix Price' value on
    the field 'Compute Price' and set a fixed price.
3.  Go to the new menu *Sales \> Products \> Pricelist Items*, select
    the previously created item and click on *Action \> Duplicate Item*.
4.  In the wizard set 'Date Start', set 'Date End' and set 'Variation %'
    to a value different from 100.
5.  Click on 'Apply' and you will see a new Price List Item that is a
    copy of the previous item. In that new Item the value of the 'Fixed
    Price' field will be the previous price plus that price multiplied
    by the variation percentage and the value of the 'Variation %' will
    contain that value.
