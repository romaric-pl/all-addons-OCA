Installation
============

There is no specific installation procedure for this module.

Configuration
=============

If you install this module after instanciating the chart of account
for your company, it is recommanded to use the account_chart_update
module from the OCA/account-financial-tools repository .

You may also need to customize your invoice layout to render
these eco taxes in the desired way.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to add the BEBAT and/or RECUPEL
taxes on the products which are subjected to these rules.

You must make sure that the sequences of the BEBAT and RECUPEL taxes
is smaller than the sequences of the VAT taxes so the VAT is correctly
computed on top of the BEBAT and RECUPEL taxes. The sequences are correct
when using l10n_be_taxes.

The module also define a specific tax code template for eco taxes which
may help in reporting, and specific expense and income account templates.
