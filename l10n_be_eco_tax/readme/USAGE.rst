To use this module, you need to add the BEBAT and/or RECUPEL
taxes on the products which are subjected to these rules.

You must make sure that the sequences of the BEBAT and RECUPEL taxes
is smaller than the sequences of the VAT taxes so the VAT is correctly
computed on top of the BEBAT and RECUPEL taxes. The sequences are correct
when using l10n_be_taxes.

The module also define a specific tax code template for eco taxes which
may help in reporting, and specific expense and income account templates.
