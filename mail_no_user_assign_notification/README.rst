This module inhibits the assignation notification from the models that we want.

   :local:

Configuration
=============

#. Go to Settings > Technical > System Parameters
#. Edit "mail_no_user_assign_notification.models" key record
#. Set any model* (for example: res.partner).

NOTE1: It is possible to set several models separated by comma (e.g.: model1,model2).

NOTE2: The model should have the field `user_id` for this to be effective.

Usage
=====

#. Go to one of the configured models (like Contacts).
#. Create or edit a record, and assign the field for the user (in contacts, it's called
   "Salesperson", in purchase orders it's "Purchase representative", etc).
#. The user won't receive the automatic assignment email.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This is not valid for project tasks users assignation, as the field is multi-relational.
  A specific extension would be needed.
