On a Sales Order, an Invoice can be generated.

On the Invoice generated from a Sales Orders, for the lines generated from the SO, the Product, Quantity and Unit Price fields should not be editable.

Changing these requires deleting (or cancelling) the draft invoice, correcting the data in the source Sales Order, and then redoing the Invoice creation.

Note that other columns can be edited, such as taxes or accounts, and that additional lines could be manually added and fully editable.
