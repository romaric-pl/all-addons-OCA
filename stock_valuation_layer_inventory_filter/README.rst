Use Cases / Context
===================

This module has been developed because when making inventory adjustments
with description, they cannot be filtered in the Inventory Valuation.

This will be useful if you want to check the difference in Total Value
for each inventory adjustment.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Inventory > Operations > Inventory Adjustments
2. Adjust multiple lines, select them and click "Apply"
3. Fill in the description of the Inventory Adjustment you are making
4. Go to Inventory > Reporting > Valuation
5. Filter by Inventory and group by Reference
