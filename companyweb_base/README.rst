Installation
============

This module can be installed in the usual way. It depends on the OCA
``web_notify`` module.

Usage
=====

This module comes with 2 security groups.

* View Companyweb Data : can see the Companyweb data tab in contacts
* Download Companyweb Data : can actually enhance data

Once your user has the correct permissions, open a partner that has a belgian
VAT number and click on the Companyweb button.

If you don't see the Companyweb button, refresh your browser page and check
that the current user is in the correct Companyweb group.

If your Companyweb credentials are not known in the system or have changed, you
will be shown a wizard to enter them.

corner of your screen.

This module has been originally developed by `ACSONE <https://acsone.eu>`_ for
Odoo version 8.

It was subsequently enhanced by Jacques-Etienne Baudoux (BCIM sprl). The data
model of that version has been preserved to facilitate porting.

In 2021, the module was redeveloped under the current form, to support the new
Companyweb SOAP api. This development has been funded by `Companyweb
<https://www.companyweb.be>`__.
