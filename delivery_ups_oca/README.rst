This module adds `UPS <https://ups.com>`_ to the available carriers.

It allows you to register shippings, generate labels, get rates from order, read
shipping states and cancel shipments using UPS webservice, so no need of exchanging
any kind of file.

When a sales order is created in Odoo and the UPS carrier is assigned, the shipping
price that will be obtained will be the price that the UPS webservice estimates
according to the order information (address and products).

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Add a carrier account with delivery type ``ups`` and fill in your credentials (UPS
   Client and UPS Client Secret)
#. Configure in Odoo all required fields of the UPS tab with your account data
   https://wwwapps.ups.com/ppc/ppc.html (Shipper number, Default Packaging, Package
   Dimension Code, Package Weight Code and File Format).
#. If yo have "Tracking state update sync" checked all delivery orders state check will
   be done querying UPS services.
#. It is possible to create a UPS carrier for cash on delivery parcels. Select the
   ``ups`` delivery type and check the "Cash on Delivery" checkbox under the "UPS" tab.
   It is required to select the "UPS COD Funds Code" when the "Cash on Delivery" option
   is selected.

**NOTE** You need to add an APP from https://developer.ups.com/ for using the
webservice.

Usage
=====

You have to set the created shipping method in the delivery order to ship:

* When the picking is 'Transferred', a *Create Shipping Label* button appears. Just
  click on it, and if all went well, the label will be 'attached'.
* If the shipment creation process fails, a validation error will appear displaying UPS
  error.
* When the delivery order is cancelled, it's automatically cancelled too in UPS.
* If you have "Tracking state update sync" checked in the shipping method, a periodical
  state check will be done querying UPS services.

======================

* Support international forms
