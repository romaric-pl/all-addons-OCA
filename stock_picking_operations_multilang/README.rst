Use Cases / Context
===================

When a company operates internationally, employees from different countries may encounter language barriers.
For instance, a warehouse manager who only understands his native language might face difficulties
if the Picking Operations report is in a different language. This module addresses such scenarios
by enabling the customization of the Picking Operations report language, ensuring it matches
the language preferences of the warehouse manager or the partner.

Configuration
=============

To set up a specific language for Picking Operations:

* Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses.
* Select the warehouse for which you want to set up the language for the Picking Operations report.
* Choose the Picking Operation Language option. There are two options:
    * Partner: It will use the language of the partner for the picking. If there is no partner for the picking, it will use the standard behavior of Odoo.
    * Warehouse: If you select this option, you must fill in the Warehouse Language field, and this will be applied to Picking Operations.
    * If left blank, it will use the standard behavior of Odoo.
