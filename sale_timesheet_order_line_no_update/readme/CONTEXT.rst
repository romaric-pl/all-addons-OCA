Use case:

A new "timesheet hours" line is added to SO related to project (or to a new SO for same customer), but hours on the previous SO line have not all been billed yet.

This module allows to add new timesheet lines related to the new SO item, while keeping the previously inputted hours related to the previous SO item.
