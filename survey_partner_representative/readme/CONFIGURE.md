Users that can make surveys on behalf of others need to have the
*Representative on surveys* special permission.

If you want to allow that a survey is filled on behalf of others by the authorized users:

1. Go to *Surveys > Surveys* and choose the survey you want to configure.
2. Go to the *Options* tab and in the *Candidates* section set the *Allow Partner Representing*
   option on.
