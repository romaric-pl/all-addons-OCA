This module allows you to set a default bank account on partners for
their vendor bills.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

-  Go to a partner form view, and edit the Default Bank Account in the
   Sales and Purchase tab. The partner must be of type 'company', or an
   individual without a parent company.

   **Note:** If you do not set this value, it will be equal to the first
   bank account created in the contact. This is the standard behaviour
   of Odoo

-  You can disable the default bank account option at contact level,
   unmarking the "Has Default Bank Account" check.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a vendor bill and select a partner with a default bank
   account. Its recipient bank account will be the default one.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This module depends on account_payment_partner. If the payment mode
   of the invoice has a payment method that does not require a bank
   account, the default bank account will be empty.
