This module unchecks the extra suggested recipients by default when going
to write a new message in a chatter thread.

Odoo suggests new recipients on several parts of the suite to accommodate
business needs. Example: on CRM opportunities, it proposes the lead
partner to be added to the thread (or to create a partner from the email
if not exists) when the partner is not follower yet. Another similar example
happens with project tasks with a linked customer that is not yet follower.
