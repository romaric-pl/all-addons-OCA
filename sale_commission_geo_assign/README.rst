Configure sales agents assigning them to a specific geographical area.

Then, automatically assign agents to customers, according to their geographical area.

A "Do not allow update with Geo Assign" setting can be activated in partner to prevent server action from editing set agents.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

Go to

Sales > Commissions Management > Agents

For every agent, you can set Countries, States or ZIP range

Usage
=====

Go to Sales > Agents > open a record: in tab "Agent information", set geographic criteria.

When using server action, this agent will be assigned to customers whose address match the set criteria.

To assign agents, go to:

Sales > Customers

Select the customers you want to assign agents to and click

Action > Add agents with geo assign

- Activating flag "Replace existing agents" will remove agents set in partner and replace them according to geographic criteria.

- Activating flag "Do not add new agents if agents are already assigned" will prevent assignation if agents are already set in partner.

- Deactivating both flags will simply add agents to existing ones in partner according to geographic criteria.
