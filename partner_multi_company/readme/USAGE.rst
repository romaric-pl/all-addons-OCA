On the partner form view, go to the "Sales & Purchases" tab, and put the
companies in which you want to use that partner. If none is selected, the
partner will be visible in all of them.

By activating setting "Set Active Company Partner" in General Settings >
Multi-Company, instead of leaving the field "Companies" not set by
default, the default company for each new partner will be the active
company of the user on record creation.
