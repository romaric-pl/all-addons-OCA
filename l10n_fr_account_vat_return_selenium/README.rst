This module aims at providing an alternative in-between 2 solutions:

* the teletransmission of VAT returns. Teletransmission of VAT return requires a paid subscription to a teletransmission gateway. Such a solution is provided by the OCA module **l10n_fr_account_vat_return_teledec**.
* the manual copy of the CA3 form on impots.gouv.fr from the lines of the VAT return in Odoo (or the PDF report generated by Odoo). As Odoo developpers, we hate stupid manual work.

This module is the only solution which proposes a sort of free tele-transmission of the CA3, via the auto-fill of the CA3 form on impots.gouv.fr. For that, this module relies on `Selenium IDE <https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/>`_, which is a plugin available for Firefox and Chrome. Selenium is a free-software project initially designed to test Websites.

This solution only works on the form 3310-CA3 ; it doesn't work when you have VAT boxes on the form 3310-A or you asked for a VAT credit reimbursement via form 3519.

Usage
=====

At the step *Automatic Lines*, you will see a button *Generate Selenium File*. When you click on this button, Odoo will generate a scenario file for Selenium IDE.

Then, follow these steps:
* in your web browser, click on the icon corresponding to Selenium IDE and load in the Selenium IDE file
* it will start a new web browser window that will connect to impots.gouv.fr
* enter your credentials for impots.gouv.fr and then the scenario will continue it's execution until the selection of the form
* select the form corresponding to the VAT period
* Odoo will fill-up all the boxes of the CA3 form with the values computed by Odoo
* Validate and form and confirm it
* Follow the process to make the corresponding payment (unless if your company has a VAT credit).

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Move the code to a python lib, to mutualize the code across Odoo versions and give the opportunity to share the feature with other projects.
