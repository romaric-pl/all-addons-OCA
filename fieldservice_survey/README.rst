This module introduces enhanced survey functionalities in the Field Service module, streamlining the process of collecting and analyzing feedback for service orders. Users can seamlessly navigate to Field Service, access settings, and select a customized FSM Order Survey Template. When generating a new order, the system prompts users to submit a survey, facilitating efficient data collection.

The module further extends capabilities by incorporating an intuitive "Survey Answer" button within the order interface. This button provides users with the flexibility to either view comprehensive statistics derived from survey responses or directly edit the survey for any necessary adjustments.

With the Field Service Survey Enhancements module, businesses can effortlessly manage and optimize their survey processes, gaining valuable insights into service performance and customer satisfaction.
