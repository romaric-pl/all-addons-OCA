This module allows to limit applied commission items for specific groups.

This module allows to manage the following commission structure use case:

  Agent A receives commission 50 when selling product 1 to customer X

  Agent A receives commission 20 when selling product 1 to customer Y

This implementation is based on pricelist-like Commission Type structure provided by sale_commission_product_criteria.

Usage
=====

Go to Sales > Commission management > Commission Type Items Groups

Create one or more new Groups, eg. “Italy” and “Spain”

Create new Commission type, select type “Product Criteria (with restrictions)”, eg: “Southern Europe”

Add lines to Commission type; for each line one Group must be set, eg.

    Product: Conference Chair, value: $20, group: Italy

    Product: Conference Chair, value: $10, group: Spain


Go to Agent A, assign Commission type: “Southern Europe” > add “Allowed Commission Groups”: “Italy”, “Spain”

In this way, we are allowing Commission type lines for both “Spain” and “Italy” to be applied to this agent.

Go to customer X, set agent: “Agent A” > in table “Commission items group” set group “Spain”

Go to customer Y, set agent: “Agent A” > in table “Commission items group” set group “Italy”

On sales for customer X, only Commission type lines with group “Spain” will be applied to agent; on sales for customer Y, only Commission type lines with group “Italy” will be applied to agent.
