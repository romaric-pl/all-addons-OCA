The interface provided by Odoo in the official *stock* module to make an inventory has 2 limitations:

* it is not easy/fast to use when you have several thousand products

* you cannot use a barcode reader to scan the products

Other community modules such as *stock_barcodes* or *mobile_app_inventory* propose a mobile interface to operate inventories using smartphones with barcode scanners. This is the most advanced solution, but it requires special hardware and these modules are have a lot of lines of code.

This module is a small-and-simple module to make an inventory using the regular web interface of Odoo with a barcode reader.
