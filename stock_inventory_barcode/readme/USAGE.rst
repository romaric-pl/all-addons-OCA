On the form view of an inventory, once the inventory has been started
(State = *In Progress*), you will see a button **Start Barcode
Interface**. It will open a pop-up window that allows the user to easily
enter the inventory quantity (or update the inventory quantity, in case
the product is found a second time at a different place during the
inventory).

The wizard screen is automatically adapted when the product is tracked by lot or serial, and if the inventory is made across several stock locations.
