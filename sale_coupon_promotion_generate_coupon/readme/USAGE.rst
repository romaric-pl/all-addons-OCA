To use this module, you need to have configured:

#. A coupon program which will be the one where the coupons will be generated.
#. A promotion program with applicability on the next order and the first program
   selected as next order program.

Then, when a user meets the promotion program requisites, a pending coupon will be
generated in the coupon program.

The user will be able to enjoy it in a later order as usual but the rules will be those
configured in that promotion.
