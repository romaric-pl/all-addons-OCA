To use this module, you need to have configured:

#. A coupon program and a promotion program as told in ``coupon_promotion_generate_coupon`` readme.

Then, when a user meets the promotion program requisites, a pending coupon will be
generated in the coupon program.

The user will be able to enjoy it in a later order as usual but the rules will be those
configured in that promotion.
