APIs with Odoo delivery system.

Installation
============

This module depends on the `suds` python library and the OCA/delivery-carrier
`delivery_package_number` and `delivery_state` modules.

The Sending API doesn't provide delivery rating methods, so OCA's
`delivery_price_method` is advised in order to use this carrier in a sales workflow.

Configuration
=============

To configure a Sending delivery method:

#. Go to *Inventory > Configuration > Delivery > Shipping methods* and create a new one.
#. Choose *Sending* as provider.
#. Configure the service parameters according to your contract considerations.
#. Choose a delivery product.

Usage
=====

These are the operations possible with this module:

Place shipping bookings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. When the picking is validated, the shipping will be booked at Sending.
#. With the response, we'll receive the delivery tracking number.

Cancel bookings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. As in other carriers, we can cancel the shipping after the picking is done. To do
   so, go to *Additional Info* tab and click on the *Cancel* action on the side of the
   tracking number.
#. We can generate a new shipping if necessary.

Get labels
~~~~~~~~~~

#. If by chance we delete the generated labels, we can obtain them again hitting the
   *Sending Label* buttons in the header of the picking form.

Known issues / Roadmap
