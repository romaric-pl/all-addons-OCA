These are the operations possible with this module:

Place shipping bookings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. When the picking is validated, the shipping will be booked at Sending.
#. With the response, we'll receive the delivery tracking number.

Cancel bookings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. As in other carriers, we can cancel the shipping after the picking is done. To do
   so, go to *Additional Info* tab and click on the *Cancel* action on the side of the
   tracking number.
#. We can generate a new shipping if necessary.

Get labels
~~~~~~~~~~

#. If by chance we delete the generated labels, we can obtain them again hitting the
   *Sending Label* buttons in the header of the picking form.
