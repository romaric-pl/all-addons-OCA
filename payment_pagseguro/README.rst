Payment Acquirer: PagSeguro Implementation

This module extends the payment module to add a new payment method: Pagseguro.

There are three ways to integrate the Pagseguro API, in this module we use the
checkout transparent approach.

You can learn more about that on this `youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DxKEKoSPkA>`_.

If you wish to use Pagseguro on production environment you need to get an approval
from pagseguro, more on that `here <https://dev.pagseguro.uol.com.br/docs/comecando-processo-de-integracao>`_.

Installation
============

This module depends on:

Configuration
=============

This module will require registering in eCommerce PagSeguro https://acesso.pagseguro.uol.com.br/

To configure your API keys go to Invoicing -> Configuration -> Payment Acquirers -> PagSeguro.
Then insert your token on the credentials page, as shown below:

    :width: 600 px

Still on the configuration tab, you can configure the maximum amount
of installments available for your clients to select at the
payment.

So far, we only support up to 12 installments, setting a value higher than
that will lead to possible errors on payment.

Usage
=====

After the configuration, you can go to the website module, and buy a product
in your website shop by selecting the Pagseguro payment method.

Here you can select:
  - Payment form (there is only credit card so far).
  - Amount of installments you want to pay (notice than the maximum value you can select is based on your acquirer configuration).

When selecting the installments you can see the value of each installment on
the input field on the right.

After that, insert you Card number, name, expiration date and security code.
Then, click on the pay now button.

So far, we support only VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Diners brands.

**notice**: The credentials that we use in this image are not from a real card,
instead this is a test card given by the Pagseguro for test purposes.
You can find more tests cards here https://dev.pagseguro.uol.com.br/reference/testing-cards.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Issues
  - To support more brands we need to overwrite the focusout event from the card number field
  - Selecting installments should also change the total price

Roadmap
  - Add bill payment form
  - Add debit card payment form
  - Add PIX payment form
