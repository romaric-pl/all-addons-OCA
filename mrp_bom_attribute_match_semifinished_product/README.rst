This module makes use of the features provided by module mrp_bom_attribute_match to create, for a finished product:

* Semi-finished products with relevant attributes and settings
* Structure of BoMs to manufacture them.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In industries like textile and apparel it’s common to have finished products with many variants for color and size, as well as several semi-finished products for various stages of manufacturing - often subcontracted.

This module leaves to the user only the following manual steps:

* creation of finished product
* creation of BoM for first semi-finished product

automating the steps in the middle.



Configuration
=============

To allow a user to use features of this module, enable technical access right "Create finished product structure".

Usage
=====

In a product template > inventory tab, enable field “Finished product” (note: it can only be enabled for products with variants).

From product template form, use server action “Create finished product structure”: a wizard is displayed with the following fields:

* **Stage name**: this field is used to provide a name to the semi-finished product; the name will be set as *product template name* - *stage name* eg: “Customizable desk (CONFIG) - Wood polishing”

* **Template product**: he semi-finished product will be created as a copy of the product template set in this field, with all the related settings (eg: routes, supplierinfo, product type…).

  Note: only product templates without attributes and values can be set in this field.

* **Attribute(s)**: this field is used to set which attributes and values to copy from finished product to semi-finished product of this stage.

  Note: each semi-finished product cannot have more attributes than the semi-finished product in previous stage.

* **BoM type**: the type of Bom to manufacture the previous product in the semi-finished product chain. If Bom Type = Subcontracting, it’s possible to set subcontractors.

  Note: in first stage, set type of BoM to manufacture finished product; in second stage, set type of BoM to manufacture first stage semi-finished product, and so on.


On creation, a BOM for finished product will be created, with:

* BoM type (and subcontractors) from first line of wizard

* semi-finished product from first line of wizard as “Component (product template)” in BoM lines

* attribute match on semi-finished product attributes.

If a second line was present in wizard, the same will happen for semi-finished product from first line, and so on.
