This module allows to set an end time on a release channel that will be transmitted on
related stock pickings (on scheduled date) when the channel awakes.

That allows to use Odoo core sorting feature on stock pickings level.

Usage
=====

#. Assign a timezone on the Warehouse address if defined and if needed
   If you have a lot of warehouses in the same timezone, you can also define
   the timezone on the company partner.
   If you don't define a timezone on the warehouse(s) nor the company, the process
   end time on channels will be considered as UTC.
#. Propagate/update scheduled date of picking follow process end date/time automatically
   by setting "Update Scheduled Date" configuration in Settings/General Settings/Inventory

#. Go To Release Channels
#. Set an end time
#. Wake up the channel
#. The assigned pickings have their scheduled date set at the next end time. (if enabled "Update Scheduled Date" config)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Maybe something to do on pickings level when setting channels asleep (storing
  the original scheduled date or ...).
