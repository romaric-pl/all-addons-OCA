# MIS Builder

Management Information System reports for Odoo: easily build super fast,
beautiful, custom reports such as P&L, Balance Sheets and more.

This project implements a class of reports where KPI (Key Performance Indicators)
are displayed in rows, and time periods in columns. It focuses on very fast reporting
on accounting data but can also use data from any other Odoo model.

It features the following key characteristics:

- User configurable: end users can create new report templates without development,
  using simple Excel-like formulas.
- Very fast balance reporting for accounting data, even on million lines databases
  and very complex account charts.
- Use the same template for different reports.
- Compare data over different time periods.
- User-configurable styles, rendered perfectly in the UI as well as Excel and PDF exports.
- Interactive display with drill-down.
- Export to PDF and Excel.
- A budgeting module.
- Evaluate KPI over various data sources, such as actuals, simulation, committed costs
  (some custom development is required to create the data source).
- For developers, the accounting balance computation engine is exposed as an easy
  to use API.

Here are some presentations:

- Odoo Experience 2017 ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/acsone/budget-control-with-misbuilder-3-2017), [video](https://youtu.be/0PpxGAf2l-0))
- Odoo Experience 2016 ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/acsone/misbuilder-2016))
- Odoo Experience 2015 ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/acsone/misbuilder))

# Field Service Management

[Field Service Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_service_management) (FSM) coordinates company resources employed at, or en route to, client sites, rather than on the company's premises. FSM most commonly refers to companies who need to manage installation, service or repairs of systems or equipment.

Examples of field service use cases are:

- In telecommunications and cable industry, technicians who install cable or run phone lines into residences or business establishments.
- In healthcare, mobile nurses who provide in-home care for elderly or disabled.
- In gas utilities, engineers who are dispatched to investigate and repair suspected leaks.
- In heavy engineering, mining, industrial and manufacturing, technicians dispatched for preventative maintenance and repair.
- In property maintenance, including landscaping, irrigation, and home and office cleaning.
- In HVAC industry, technicians have the expertise and equipment to investigate units in residential, commercial and industrial environments.
