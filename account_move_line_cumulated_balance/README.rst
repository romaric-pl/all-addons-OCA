This module allows you to show the cumulated balance, both in the company
currency and in the original currency, on the general ledger and partner ledger
menus, which is an aid for accountants that need to check the evolution of the
balances.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

To see all the menus, make sure:

* Your user is member of the group
  "Technical Settings / Show Full Accounting Features"
* The page is running in debug mode or you have the `base_technical_features`
  module installed and belonging to such group.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Invoicing > Accounting > General Ledger* or
   *Invoicing > Accounting > Partner Ledger*
#. Two new columns will be available:

   * Cumulated Balance
   * Cumulated Balance in Currency

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* For v14, there's a similar feature, but it doesn't cumulate in an absolute way like
  this one, and there's no cumulated in amount currency, so this module may be fully
  preserved.
* There's no support for filtering at the same time by several entries state (posted,
  not posted, cancel, etc).
* In the partner ledger, removing the group by partner won't make the cumulated balances
  to be considered globally by account.
