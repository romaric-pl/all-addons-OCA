* For v14, there's a similar feature, but it doesn't cumulate in an absolute way like
  this one, and there's no cumulated in amount currency, so this module may be fully
  preserved.
* There's no support for filtering at the same time by several entries state (posted,
  not posted, cancel, etc).
* In the partner ledger, removing the group by partner won't make the cumulated balances
  to be considered globally by account.
