This module is a 'glue' module for the modules stock_move_location and stock_move_purchase_uom.
If an operation type has the option "use purchase uom" enabled, when creating a transfer for that
operation using the "Move to location" button, the uom of the products in the transfer will be set
to the purchase uom of the products.
