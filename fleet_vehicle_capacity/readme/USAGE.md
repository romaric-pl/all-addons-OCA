To use this module, it first needs to be installed. Upon installation, the system will automatically detect the default units of measure (UOM) for vehicle weight, volume, and passenger capacity, and assign them to vehicle models accordingly.

The module enhances the Odoo Fleet Management system by allowing administrators to configure default UOMs for:

* Vehicle Weight (tons)
* Vehicle Volume Capacity (cubic meters)
* Passenger Capacity (number of passengers)

Key Features:
* Automatic Assignment of Default UOMs: After installation, the system automatically assigns default UOMs to vehicle models based on the standard UOMs (tons, cubic meters, and units).
* Configurable UOMs: The administrator can update the default UOMs for vehicle weight, volume, and passenger capacity through the system settings. Changes made to the default UOMs will be applied to all new vehicle models automatically.
* Editable Vehicle Model UOMs: While vehicle models use the default UOMs upon creation, the administrator can still manually override the UOMs for specific models if needed.
