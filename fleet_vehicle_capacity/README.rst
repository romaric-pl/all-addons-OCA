This module adds fields to manage the weight and volume capacity in the
vehicle model. It is also designed to be easily expandable, allowing the
addition of other vehicle-specific capacities in the future as needed.

Usage
=====

To use this module, it first needs to be installed. Upon installation,
the system will automatically detect the default units of measure (UOM)
for vehicle weight, volume, and passenger capacity, and assign them to
vehicle models accordingly.

The module enhances the Odoo Fleet Management system by allowing
administrators to configure default UOMs for:

-  Vehicle Weight (tons)
-  Vehicle Volume Capacity (cubic meters)
-  Passenger Capacity (number of passengers)

Key Features:

-  Automatic Assignment of Default UOMs: After installation, the system
   automatically assigns default UOMs to vehicle models based on the
   standard UOMs (tons, cubic meters, and units).
-  Configurable UOMs: The administrator can update the default UOMs for
   vehicle weight, volume, and passenger capacity through the system
   settings. Changes made to the default UOMs will be applied to all new
   vehicle models automatically.
-  Editable Vehicle Model UOMs: While vehicle models use the default
   UOMs upon creation, the administrator can still manually override the
   UOMs for specific models if needed.
