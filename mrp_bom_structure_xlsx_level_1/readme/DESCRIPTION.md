This module extends the functionality of the MRP capabilities of Odoo,
and allows you to export to level 1 of the BoM structure to MS Excel
.XLSX format.

If you have a Bill of Materials (A) for which one of the Components also has a Bill of Materials (B),
the report will only display the Components within the first level for the selected Bill of Materials (A),
but not the Components from the Bill of Materials (B).
