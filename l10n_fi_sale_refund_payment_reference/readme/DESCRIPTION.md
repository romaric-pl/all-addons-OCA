In finnish B2B accounting, it is customary to not pay refunds to
customers as money. Instead refunds are used to deduct payable amounts
from future invoices. As such, refund invoices are also given payment
references, to make tracking and reconciling them easier. By default,
Odoo generates payment references only for sales invoices. With this
module, references are generated also for sales refunds.
