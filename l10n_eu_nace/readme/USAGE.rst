Once this module is installed, you can assign NACE categories to your partners
by simply adding the corresponding category in the partner's form.

Obtaining updated data
======================
The data is imported from the new NACE Rev. 2 classification, which is hosted in
ShowVoc. This is a new platform that replaces the old Eurostat RAMON service and
uses SPARQL to retrieve the data.

If you want to import or update the data, you can do so by running the Import
NACE Wizard. This will search for all active languages in Odoo and import the
data for each one. **If you activate a new language, remember to run this wizard
again.**

1. Go to "Contacts" > "Configuration" > "Import NACE industries"
2. Click on the "Import NACE" button.

This might take a minute or so depending on the number of languages and the
speed of your connection.
