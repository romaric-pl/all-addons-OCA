package in picking

Use Cases / Context
===================

Let's imagine you have a parcel forwarding business. You receive small
packages from your customer pack them into bigger ones and forward
afterwards.

To complete this operation using the standard Odoo flow:

-  Create a new picking
-  Add each item of the "Source package" to the list of operations
-  Manually set the "Destination package" for each line
-  Validate
-  Items from the source package are moved to the destination package

This is really time consuming and not convenient because you just want
to move the entire package at once. Especially if you want to move
multiple packages at once each of them containing multiple items.

With this module you get the following:

-  Create a new picking
-  Add packages directly in the "Move packages" list
-  Define the "Destination package"
-  Validate
-  Items from the source package are moved to the destination package

Pros: instead of scanning each package item separately and configuring a
destination for it we can do the same operation on the package level
much faster and more convenient.

Configuration
=============

Go to "Inventory -> Configuration -> Operation Types" and select an
operation type.

Ensure "Move Entire Packages" checkbox is enabled.

Usage
=====

Create or open an existing picking. There will be a new "Destination
Package" field available in the packages move list.

**NB:** This field is editable only if the stock moves are the 'draft'
state. You need to unreserve the picking to change the value.
