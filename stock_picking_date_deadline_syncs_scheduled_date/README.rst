This module extends the functionality of Stock Picking dates to align
the Deadline Date field with the Planned Date field in the first
instance and to allow the Planned Date field to be used as a reference
field when preparing deliveries.

As usual, allows the Planned Date field to be freely changed without
affecting the Deadline Date field, but if the Deadline date field is
changed on Pickings through another module, the Planned Date field on
the Picking will also be updated to the Deadline Date.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module has been developed to allow the Scheduled date field on
Pickings (and Date on moves) to be used as a reference field for
planning purposes when products have to be shipped on the same day that
needs to be delivered.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Sell a storable product to create pickings or create a new delivery.
2. Confirm the sale or picking.
3. Add the Commitment date to sale or Deadline date on stock moves. This
   will change deadline date and scheduled date of your pickings.
4. Change again Commitment date on sales or Deadline date on stock
   moves. This will change deadline date and scheduled date of your
   pickings.
5. Go to the picking and change Schedule date if you want to make a
   rescheduling.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

To be able to configure the Planned date some days before Deadline date.
