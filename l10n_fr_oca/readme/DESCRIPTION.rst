This module provides the chart of accounts, taxes and fiscal positions for companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, RÃ©union, Mayotte, etc.).

This module is a fork of the **l10n_fr** module from the official addons. The decision to maintain a fork was taken after the merge of this huge `pull request <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/84918>`_ on Odoo version 14.0 on October 6th 2022. This pull request increased the number of taxes to 67 (!) and suffer the contrains of the VAT module of Odoo Enterprise. It broke 2 OCA modules: **l10n_fr_account_tax_unece** and the test suite of **l10n_fr_account_vat_return**.

The goals of the fork are:

* provide a reasonable number of taxes (35 taxes, compared to 67 which is about half the number of taxes provided by the **l10n_fr** module !),
* provide a clean and up-to-date chart of account for France (up-to-date with official chart of account of the `ANC <https://www.anc.gouv.fr/>`_ published on January 1st 2019),
* provide taxes, fiscal positions and a chart of accounts properly configured for the OCA module **l10n_fr_account_vat_return**, the opensource VAT module for France,
* keep compatibility with **l10n_fr** (you can have both **l10n_fr** and **l10n_fr_oca** installed on the same Odoo database).
