This module builds on `stock_restrict_lot` and exposes the field
`restrict_lot_id` of `stock.move`, allowing the user to update or
even remove the lot restriction if the product does not fall within
a domain.

The domain can be updated in the settings of each individual company.

Any change to `restrict_lot_id` is propagated to linked stock moves,
but only forwards, not backwards.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In a setup where lot selection is managed both at sale level and warehouse level
(but the final call is made by warehouse flows), there can be the need to select
a different lot than the one set in sale order line. As current sale order lot
selection modules are depending on stock_restrict_lot (which doesn't allow to
select a different lot in picking), this module allows to limit the restriction
to for specific products.

Usage
=====

Go to Settings > Inventory > Enforce lot restrictions

Set a domain for the products for which lot restriction on stock moves should apply (empty domain: all products)
