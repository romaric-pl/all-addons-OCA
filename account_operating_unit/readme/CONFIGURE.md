If your company is required to generate a balanced balance sheet by
Operating Unit you can specify at company level that Operating Units
should be self-balanced, and then indicate a self-balancing clearing
account.

1.  Create an account "Inter-OU Clearing". It is a balance sheet
    account.
2.  Go to *Settings / Companies / Configuration* and Set the "Operating
    Units are self-balanced" checkbox. Then set the "Inter-OU Clearing"
    account in "Inter-Operating Unit clearing account" field.
3.  Go to *Accounting / Configuration / Accounting / Journals* and
    define, for each Payment Method, the Operating Unit that will be
    used in payments.
