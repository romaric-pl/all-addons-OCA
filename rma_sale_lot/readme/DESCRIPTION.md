This module extends the rma_lot module by integrating lot tracking into the
return wizard in the sales orders. It assists salespeople in accurately
recording returns by ensuring that customers are returning the correct lot that
was originally delivered.

This enhancement improves both tracking and inventory accuracy, leading to
more efficient and reliable return processing.
