This modules define a "Collection Price" on the delivery method. This
represents the fee that a courier may apply for collecting a package,
separate from the shipping cost proper.

If the "Collection Product" is defined on the Delivery Method,
two products representing shipping will be added to a Sales Order

The separation of shipping in two products facilitates treating them
differently - for example, one may want to discount the
shipping cost but not the collection cost.
