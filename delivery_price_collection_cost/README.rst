This modules define a "Collection Price" on the delivery method. This
represents the fee that a courier may apply for collecting a package,
separate from the shipping cost proper.

If the "Collection Product" is defined on the Delivery Method,
two products representing shipping will be added to a Sales Order

The separation of shipping in two products facilitates treating them
differently - for example, one may want to discount the
shipping cost but not the collection cost.

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Sales Orders > Delivery Methods*.
#. Open or create a new one.
#. Select a Collection Product.
#. Depending on the delivery type, you can set a fixed collection price, or a collection price for each individual rule.
#. Apply shipping costs to a Sales Order as normal: if the delivery method has a Collection Product set, two lines will be created for shipping.
