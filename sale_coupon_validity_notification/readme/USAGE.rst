To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Promotion programs* and create a promotions program to
   generate a coupon with a sales order (by checking the `Send coupon` option).
#. Create a sales order that meets the requirements of the previous promotions program
   and click on `Save`.
#. Click on `Promotions` and confirm the order. Now, the status of the coupon is "Valid".
#. View the code of the generated coupon, create another sales order for the same
   customer, and apply the coupon.
#. Modify or cancel the sales order that generated the coupon, and then click on
   `Promotions` again.
#. Now, the status of the coupon should be "Expired" and in the sales order where it was
   applied, there should be a note and an activity reflecting that the coupon is no
   longer valid.
