When a coupon is generated by a sales order, if it is modified or cancelled and no
longer meets the promotion program requirements that generated it, the coupon becomes
invalid. To avoid confusion and errors in billing if the coupon was applied to another
sales order while it was valid, this module generates an activity and a note recording
the situation in the sales order where the coupon is applied. This way, users can manage
the use of coupons more effectively in their sales orders, avoiding errors and improving
the efficiency of their sales processes.
