To configure the contact generation:

#. Go to the configured survey.
#. In the *Contact* section of the *Options* tab, set
   *Generate Contact* on, if you want contacts to be
   generated from the answers to this survey.
#. If you want the generated to have a parent company, set the option
   *Create Parent Contact* and link the `company_name` field to a question in the
   survey.
#. In each question associated with a future new contact,
   specify the corresponding contact field. To do this,
   go to the 'Options' tab, then navigate to the 'Contact' group,
   and select the 'Contact field' field.
