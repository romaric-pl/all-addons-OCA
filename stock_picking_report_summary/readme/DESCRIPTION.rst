Select several Pickings to print a PDF summary with two sheets :

* Products Summary (where the total sum is calculated for each product)

* Detail Part (each delivery is detailed product by product, with lines at 0 printed in grey)

You can choose to print standard prices or not (can be useful to check some
values when you prepare your pickings).
