This module extends the functionality of the sale_order_whole_delivered_invoiceability
module by adding the option to prevent the invoicing of sales orders until all material
has been delivered on the sales order types, being propagated from them where they
are used in the sales order.

Configuration
=============

#. Create or modify a sales order type.
#. Activate the option ‘Whole Delivered Invoiceability’.

Usage
=====

To use this module you need to:

#. Create a sales order.
#. Set the above sales order type.
#. Do a partial delivery.

Although it is possible to create an invoice from the order itself, the ‘Create invoice’ button will remain white and the order will not appear in the list of orders to be invoiced, which can be consulted from the ‘To invoice’ menu.
