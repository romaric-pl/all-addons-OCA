This module allows you to set a default bank account purchase orders.
That bank account will be propagated to its vendor bills.

   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

-  Go to a partner form view, and edit the Default Bank Account in the
   Sales and Purchase tab. The partner must be set as a 'company', or as
   an individual without a parent company.

   **Note:** If you do not set this value, it will be equal to the first
   bank account created in the contact. This is the standard behaviour
   of Odoo

-  You can disable the default bank account option at contact level,
   unmarking the "Has Default Bank Account" check.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a purchase order. On the other info tab you can see its bank
   account, which will be equal to the configured in the partner's
   "Default Bank Account" field.
2. Confirm the purchase and create its vendor bill. Its recipient bank
   account will be equal to the purchase's bank account.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  This module depends on account_payment_purchase. If the payment mode
   of the purchase has a payment method that does not require a bank
   account, the default bank account will be empty.
