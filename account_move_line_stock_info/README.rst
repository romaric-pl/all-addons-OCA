Usage
=====

-  A user that has access to the inventory app plus at least readonly
   access to the accounting features can view the stock move of each
   journal item or journal entry as a column of the journal item tree
   view. It is hidden by default. The field is also visible on the
   journal item form view.
-  Similarly, a user that has access to both the accounting app and the
   inventory app can inspect the journal items related to a stock move
   by clicking on the operations of a validated transfer. This will open
   the simplified form view of the stock move. If there are any related
   (valuation) journal items, they will be visible under the operation
   detail lines.
