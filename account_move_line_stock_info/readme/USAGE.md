- A user that has access to the inventory app plus at least readonly access to
  the accounting features can view the stock move of each journal item or
  journal entry as a column of the journal item tree view. It is hidden by
  default. The field is also visible on the journal item form view.
- Similarly, a user that has access to both the accounting app and the inventory
  app can inspect the journal items related to a stock move by clicking on the
  operations of a validated transfer. This will open the simplified form view
  of the stock move. If there are any related (valuation) journal items, they
  will be visible under the operation detail lines.
