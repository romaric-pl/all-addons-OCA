The pull list checks the stock situation at the given location and calculates
the shortfall quantities (quantity needed to cover all needs) for products.
Procurements can be created for these shortfall quantities.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Usage
=====

To use the module follow the next steps:

#. Go to *Inventory > Operations > Generate Pull List*.
#. Select the location to get the pull list from. Add some filtering if needed.
#. Click on Prepare. You will now see the pull list with all the needs.
#. Adjust grouping options as needed. This will generate different procurement
   groups.
#. Click on *Procure*.

Wizard can be also launched through a server action on multiple transfers; this is to allow user to select with ease which transfers to include in the pull list. Please note that:

#. To select a transfer to be included in pull list through server action, you first need to go to its operation type and enable field "Allow pull list server action".
#. Only transfers with the same Source Location can be selected at one time.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* In wizard, when `exclude_reserved` is selected, handle partially available moves.
* Use sequence numbering for procurement groups made from pull list.
* Return a pull list summary at the end.
