This module adds the capability to show discrepancies for each line in an inventory and 
to block inventory validation (setting it as 'Pending to Approve') when the discrepancy
exceeds a user-defined threshold. This is configurable per company through the settings.

Only new group "Validate All inventory Adjustments" will be able to force the
validation of those blocked inventories. By default, Stock manager will belong
to this group. In addition, Stock Users can validate inventories under the
threshold now.
