1. **Set Document Date on Invoice:**
   - Navigate to the invoice and set the analytic document date.
   - If the analytic document date is not set, it will automatically be assigned the invoice date upon confirmation.

2. **Analytic Line Generation:**
   - If any line has analytic information, the generated analytic entry will inherit the analytic document date.

3. **Setting Document Date in Reconcile View:**
   - You can also set the analytic document date from the reconciliation view, but this option is available only during manual reconciliation.
