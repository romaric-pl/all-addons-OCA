The module introduces a new field in the accounting records to specify the "Accrual Date" for income and expenses. This field is crucial for accurately tracking when the revenue or expense is earned or incurred, regardless of the invoice creation date.

For instance, if an invoice is created in December but refers to sales made in November, the Accrual Date allows us to reflect this correctly in our accounting records. This ensures compliance with accrual-based accounting principles and provides better insights into the financial period to which transactions belong.

This feature is particularly valuable for businesses that need to differentiate between the accounting period of transaction occurrence and the timing of document issuance.
