The module introduces a new field in the accounting records to specify
the "Accrual Date" for income and expenses. This field is crucial for
accurately tracking when the revenue or expense is earned or incurred,
regardless of the invoice creation date.

For instance, if an invoice is created in December but refers to sales
made in November, the Accrual Date allows us to reflect this correctly
in our accounting records. This ensures compliance with accrual-based
accounting principles and provides better insights into the financial
period to which transactions belong.

This feature is particularly valuable for businesses that need to
differentiate between the accounting period of transaction occurrence
and the timing of document issuance.

Usage
=====

1. **Set Document Date on Invoice:**

   - Navigate to the invoice and set the analytic document date.
   - If the analytic document date is not set, it will automatically be
     assigned the invoice date upon confirmation.

2. **Analytic Line Generation:**

   - If any line has analytic information, the generated analytic entry
     will inherit the analytic document date.

3. **Setting Document Date in Reconcile View:**

   - You can also set the analytic document date from the reconciliation
     view, but this option is available only during manual
     reconciliation.
