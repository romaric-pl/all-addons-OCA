When a product is tracked by lot or serial number and is returned by a
customer, itâ€™s crucial to clearly indicate to the user which lot or
serial number can be accepted. This way, we prevent user from receiving
a product with a lot or serial number different from the original
delivery.

This module enhances the return process by creating a separate return
line for each product/lot and automatically pre-filling it with the lot
from the original delivery. It relies on the `Stock Restrict
Lot <https://github.com/OCA/stock-logistics-workflow/tree/16.0/stock_restrict_lot>`__
module to enforce accurate tracking, ensuring that the reception order
reflects the correct lot or serial number that should be received.
