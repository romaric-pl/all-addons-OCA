This module adds a reallocate button to dispatch a picking moves between several new pickings.

It uses a stored instance to allow saving current dispatching for later.

**Table of contents**

Usage
=====

Click on the `Start reallocation` button on top of a picking to start distributing the moves.

In the Reallocation pop-up adds the desired number of dates (up until 5) and reallocate each move quantity.

You can save your changes without starting the reallocation by clicking on `Save for later` button.

When you are done click the `Reallocate` button.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* **No move lines synchronization** -- For now, move lines are copied at
  reallocation creation and do not update when picking move lines change.
