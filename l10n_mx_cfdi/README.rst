Usage
=====

Service Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right now, this module works only with Facturama as the PAC, so anyone
who want to make use of it needs to have an account configured in
`Facturama <https://facturama.mx/>`__

1. Go to Invoicing > Configuration > CFDI > Service Configuration
2. Click **"New"** to add your *Facturama* account

   1. "*Name"* -> Name of the service. Name it "Facturama"
   2. *"User"* -> Your facturama account Username
   3. *"Password"* -> Your facturama account password
   4. *"Sandbox mode"* -> If you don't want to send your invoices to SAT
      and just test

Issuers
~~~~~~~

This module lets the user choose between different profiles that will
emmit the invoice

1. Go to Invoicing > Configuration > CFDI > Issuers
2. Click **"New"** to add an Issuer

   1. *"Name"* -> Name of the issuer. This is just to locate it
   2. *"Fiscal Name"* -> The real name of the issuer (natural or legal)
   3. *"Service"* -> The service generated (facturama for now)

3. Click **"Register"**
4. If the issuer is registered correctly, the checkbox will appear
   checked and the error message will disappear
