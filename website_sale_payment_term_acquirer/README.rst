This module allows:

1. To relate payment acquirers used in checkout to payment terms: if a payment acquirer is related to a payment term, when the payment acquirer is selected the payment term is selected in the corresponding SO.
2. To display the name of a specific payment acquirer in checkout with the name of the payment term set in partner related to the user completing the ecommerce order. This payment acquirer is not displayed during the checkout if partner related to user does not have a payment term set.
