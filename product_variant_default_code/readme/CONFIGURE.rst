To configure the default code of the product variant, it is necessary:

#. Edit or create the attributes that define the variants of a product, adding an
   abbreviation that identifies the attribute in the `Attribute Code` field, also in
   the `Attribute Value Code` field of the attribute values. These abbreviations will
   appear in the default code of the product variant.
   Example: `Colour - C`, `White - Wh`

By default the product code is assigned and updated automatically, to do it manually
it is necessary:

#. Activate the option `Default product code Manual mask` from settings.
#. Edit or create a product variant and activate the option `Manual Reference`.
   If the `Internal Reference` field is edited, the above option will be activated when
   the changes are saved.

To be able to edit the reference mask, the user must have the
`Product Default Code Behavior` permission active.
