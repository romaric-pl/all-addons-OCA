This module extends the functionality of accounting to let you quickly
find which journal items are due today and register payments for them
individually, even if they are partial invoice payments. They also get
appropriately matched automatically.

In simpler words, you can find and register due payments, regardless if
the invoice had one or more payment terms.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because in the invoices list view, Odoo only
displays the due date of each invoice's last payment. However, most
times you only need to know which payments are due *today*, even if
there's a later payment for that invoice.

At the same time, if you register a partial payment, Odoo will match it
only partially, even when that was the expected payment due.

When there are a lot of partial payments, it becomes impossible to
handle manually without a module like this one.

Configuration
=============

To use this module, if you're using Odoo CE:

#. Activate the developer mode. #. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies >
Groups*. #. Edit *Technical / Show Full Accounting Features*. #. Add
yourself to *Users*

Usage
=====

To find unmatched payments due today (or before):

1. Go to *Accounting > Accounting > Journals > Journal Items*.
2. Go to *Filters > Overdue*.
3. Filter also by *Filters > Receivable* or *Filters > Payable*. You
   can't mix both in the next step.
4. Select all payments to pay.
5. Click on *Actions > Register payment*.
6. Register the payment as you usually do from the invoices view.

Only those payments that you selected will be registered. They will
become fully matched.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  To use this new feature, you need full accounting permissions (a.k.a.
   Bookkeeper).
-  Invoicing users should be able too.
-  A good improvement would be to display *Next due date* in invoices
   views.
-  Also to allow somehow paying only overdue payments when using the
   register payment wizard.
-  This feature already exists in Odoo 17 under *Invoicing >
   Customers/Vendors > Amounts to settle*, so there's no need to
   forward-port this module.
