To find unmatched payments due today (or before):

1. Go to *Accounting > Accounting > Journals > Journal Items*.
1. Go to *Filters > Overdue*.
1. Filter also by *Filters > Receivable* or *Filters > Payable*. You can't mix
   both in the next step.
1. Select all payments to pay.
1. Click on *Actions > Register payment*.
1. Register the payment as you usually do from the invoices view.

Only those payments that you selected will be registered. They will become
fully matched.
