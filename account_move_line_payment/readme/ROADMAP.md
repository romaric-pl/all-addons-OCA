- To use this new feature, you need full accounting permissions (a.k.a. Bookkeeper).
- Invoicing users should be able too.
- A good improvement would be to display *Next due date* in invoices views.
- Also to allow somehow paying only overdue payments when using the register payment wizard.
- This feature already exists in Odoo 17 under *Invoicing > Customers/Vendors > Amounts to settle*, so there's no need to forward-port this module.
