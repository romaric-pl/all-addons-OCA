    # this, installing this module will try to upgrade cryptography to the latest
    # version because the minimum required version in pysaml2 (>=3.1) is greater than
    # version 2.6 (from Odoo's requirement.txt). Since cryptography/pyopenssl don't
    # declare minimum supported versions, this lead to inconsistencies.
