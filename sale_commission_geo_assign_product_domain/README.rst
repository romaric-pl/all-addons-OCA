This is a bridge module between sale_commission_product_criteria_domain and sale_commission_geo_assign. It allows to address the following use case:

- Assign Agent 1 to customers with address in Spain, and restrict Agent 1's applicable commission type lines to those related to group "Spain";

- Assign Agent 1 to customers with address in Italy, and restrict Agent 1's applicable commission type lines to those related to group "Italy".

Configuration
=============

In agents with assigned commission type "Product criteria (with restrictions)" it's now possible to set more than one geographic criteria for assignation. Each geo-assignation line must have at least one commission type line group set.

Usage
=====

Use server action "Add agents with geo assign" on partners as per sale_commission_geo_assign behavior. Lines in table "Commission items group" will be populated with the commission item groups set in agent's geo-assignation criteria.
