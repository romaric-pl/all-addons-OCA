This module adds a restriction in purchase and supplier invoices that has the
mark "Order and invoice only supplied products" checked for allowing to select
only products that can be supplied by the defined vendor.

The restriction can also be set company-wise or for each partner, and it's propagated
to their supplier invoices and purchases, but it can be changed for each
invoice and purchase order if you want.

**Table of contents**

Usage
=====

In PO and invoice, enable boolean "Use only allowed products" to limit product selection on lines to products for which the vendor has a supplierinfo.

In partner, enable boolean "Order and invoice only supplied products" to find **"Use only allowed products" automatically enabled for this partner in PO/invoice**.

In settings > purchase, enable boolean "Force "Use only allowed products" by default" to disable boolean in partner and have **"Use only allowed products" always enabled by default in PO/invoice**.

In user, enable extra right "Hide "Use only allowed products" in PO and invoice" to prevent this user from having **"Use only allowed products" displayed in PO/invoice**.
