To create new announcements a user should be in the *Announcements
Managers* group. When your user has such permissions, this is the way to
create an announcement:

1.  Go to *Discuss \> Announcements*
2.  Create a new one and define a title. This title will be shown in the
    announcement header.
3.  Define the announcement scope:
    - Specific users: manually select which users will see the
      announcement.
    - User groups: users from the selected groups will be the ones to
      see the announcement.
4.  Define the announcement body. You can use rich formatting and event
    paste your own html (editor in debug mode).
5.  By default, the announcement will be archived. This is to prevent
    the announcement to show up before time.
6.  Once the announcement is ready, unarchive it going to the *Actions*
    menu an choosing the *Unarchive* option.
7.  Optionally you can set an announcement date to schedule the
    announcement. The announcement won't show up until that date.
8.  If the announcement doesn't make sense once a date is passed, you
    can set a due date. From that date, the announcement won't be shown
    to anyone.
