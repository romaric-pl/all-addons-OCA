Use Inventory > Operations > Release Channels to access to the dashboard.

Each channel has a dashboard with statistics about the number of transfers
to release and of the progress of the released transfers.

When clicking on the "box" button, transfers are released automatically, to
reach a total of <Max Transfers to release> (option configured in the channel
settings).
