To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Inventory / Operations and open or create an outgoing pending picking.
2. In the Additional Info tab, assign it a delivery carrier which is manual.
3. Validate the picking and youâ€™ll see in the same tab the delivery state info with the shipping date and the shipping state. Note: The  carrier tracking state fields will not be displayed for being manual.
4. You will be able to edit the delivery_state field. If you set the field to "Customer delivered" or "Warehouse Delivered", the "Delivery Date" field will be automatically set. If you set the field to "Shipping recorded in carrier", the "Shipment Date" will be automatically set.
