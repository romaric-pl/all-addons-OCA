Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Inventory / Configuration / Shipping Methods and open the
   desired method to be manual.
2. Mark the "Manual" field

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Inventory / Operations and open or create an outgoing pending
   picking.
2. In the Additional Info tab, assign it a delivery carrier which is
   manual.
3. Validate the picking and you’ll see in the same tab the delivery
   state info with the shipping date and the shipping state. Note: The
   carrier tracking state fields will not be displayed for being manual.
4. You will be able to edit the delivery_state field. If you set the
   field to "Customer delivered" or "Warehouse Delivered", the "Delivery
   Date" field will be automatically set. If you set the field to
   "Shipping recorded in carrier", the "Shipment Date" will be
   automatically set.
