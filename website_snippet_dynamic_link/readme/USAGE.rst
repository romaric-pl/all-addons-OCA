To use the new snippet:

* Go to any page in your website;
* Click "Edit" to enter edit mode;
* Go to the "Blocks" sidebar, at the "Inner Content" section;
* Drag and Drop the "Dynamic Link" block anywhere in your page;

The block comes pre-filled with one element for each dynamic link record you
defined for the current website. Each element is displayed using the image you
selected, has a tooltip which will contain the name of the link and,
when clicked, it will open (in a new page) the URL you set.

You can customize the style of the whole block in the Options tab.
More precisely, you can set the size of the icons and their style choosing
among the options provided.

Please, notice that this block is rendered each time your page is loaded and
for this reason it will immediately adapt to changes in your back-end settings.
For example, you won't need to edit the page each time you add, edit or remove
a dynamic link record. But this also mean that you cannot customize the content
of this block from website builder mode.
