Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to a contact and select an option in the field "Tax Calculation Rounding
   Method". This option will be selected by default in sale orders in which this
   contact is set as the invoice address.
#. In the simplified view of a child contact, the "Tax Calculation Rounding Method"
   field is only visible if the child contact is an "Invoice Address".
#. If no option is selected in a sale order, the rounding method set in the company
   configuration will be applied.
#. If a contact has child contacts, these child contacts will not inherit the parent
   contact's rounding method.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to the "Other Information" tab in a sale order to select the rounding method in
   the "Tax Calculation Rounding Method" field. If no option is selected, the rounding
   method set in the company configuration will be applied.
#. If the customer has a value in its "Tax Calculation Rounding Method" field, it will
   be set in the sale order when this contact is selected as the invoice address. This
   option can be changed in the sale order.
#. When multiple sale orders are selected to be invoiced together, the "Tax
   Calculation Rounding Method" is used as a grouping field (i.e. if four sale orders
   are selected, two of them have the "per line" rounding method and the other two
   have the "global rounding" method, two invoices will be generated).
