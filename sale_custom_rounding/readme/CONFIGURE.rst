To configure this module, you need to:

#. Go to a contact and select an option in the field "Tax Calculation Rounding
   Method". This option will be selected by default in sale orders in which this
   contact is set as the invoice address.
#. In the simplified view of a child contact, the "Tax Calculation Rounding Method"
   field is only visible if the child contact is an "Invoice Address".
#. If no option is selected in a sale order, the rounding method set in the company
   configuration will be applied.
#. If a contact has child contacts, these child contacts will not inherit the parent
   contact's rounding method.
