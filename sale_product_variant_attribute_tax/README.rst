This module uses *product_variant_attribute_tax* for adding the taxes set
on product attribute values when adding a product in sales orders that contains
this attribute value.

Use Cases / Context
===================

As the product taxes are defined at product template level, you can't have some variants with an specific tax.

These modules family covers the gap, adding the taxes at attribute level. This design decision has been taken for allowing to define the tax only once, as other options like having taxes at product variant level will force you to define the specific taxes for each of the variants that are affected.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Orders > Quotations*, create a new quotation or edit
   an existing one.
#. Create a new order line or edit an existing one.
#. when editing the table "Product attributes", the taxes of that sales
   line will be completed with the default taxes of the attribute value
   specified.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- This module requires `sale_variant_configurator` as a way to avoid 2 glue modules, but it may be independent.
