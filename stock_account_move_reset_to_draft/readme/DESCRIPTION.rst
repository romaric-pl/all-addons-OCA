This module allows a vendor bill to be reverted to draft status even
when an SVL (Stock Valuation Layer) record is created due to a price difference between the receipt and the vendor bill,
when inventory from the receipt has yet to be consumed.
When a vendor bill is reset to draft, as applicable, a new SVL record is generated to offset the valuation difference that was generated upon the bill's confirmation.
