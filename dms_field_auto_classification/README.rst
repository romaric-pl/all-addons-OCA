Configuration
=============

#. Go to `Documents / Configuration / Classification Templates` and create or edit a template.

Full example from res.partner:

Filename pattern: ([0-9]{8}[A-Z]).*.pdf
Details: VAT (field) and 0 (index)
Directory Pattern example 1: {0} > This will attempt to add the files to the directory linked to the partner with the VAT name.
Directory Pattern example 2: {0} / Misc > This will attempt to add the files to the "Misc" subdirectory linked to the partner with the VAT name.
