Allow to identify database attachments through their hash, avoiding duplicates.

This is typically useful when you want to save attachments to database but you want to save space avoiding to write the same content in several attachments (think of email attachments, for example, or any file uploaded more than once).

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

Set system parameter ``ir_attachment.location`` to ``hashed_db`` to activate saving by checksum.

Run ``force_storage``, method of ``ir.attachment``, to move existing attachments.
