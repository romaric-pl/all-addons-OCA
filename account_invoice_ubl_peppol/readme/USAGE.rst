In the invoice form click on button `Send & Print`.

If the invoice matches the configured domain for PEPPOL, the invoice will be generated
and validated according to the stricter PEPPOL 3.0 BIS standard.

The validator on https://test.peppolautoriteit.nl/validate can be used to test the
validity of the generated XML file. There are other online validators around as well.
