With module `Account Invoice UBL`, invoices are generated according to generic UBL rules.

In Europe, some countries use the PEPPOL 3.0 BIS standard as a more strict subset of UBL.

With this module you can specify some or all of your invoices to be generated and validated
according to this stricter standard.
