This module integrates timesheet tracking with quality control inspections. It adds a "Timesheets" tab to the quality control inspection form, allowing users to log and track the time spent on each inspection through timesheet entries. Users can record detailed timesheet data, such as the project, task, date, and duration for each inspection. Additionally, the module automatically calculates the total hours spent on inspections and displays this information in both the form view and the list view of quality control inspections.
