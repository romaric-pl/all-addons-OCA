This modules allows to use supplier info structure, available in
*Purchase* tab of the product form, also for defining customer information,
allowing to define prices per customer and product.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

There's a new section in the *Sales* tab of the product form called "Customers",
where you can define pricelist-like records for customers with the same
structure as the suppliers:

- custom price for a specific customer
- minimum quantity to purchase for this price to apply
- when the price is valid (start and end)
- custom product name and code for a specific customer

There's a new option on pricelist items that allows to get the prices from the
supplierinfo at the product form. These prices will only apply through a pricelist using such rule.

Usage
=====

#. Navigate to a product page. In the *Sales* tab, add a new line to the table labelled "Customers" to add a specify a custom price for a given customer
#. Create a new pricelist, and a pricelist item that applies to the product. In the "price computation" section, choose "Formula" and then for "Based on" pick "Partner Prices on Product form"
#. Create a Sales Order for the customer you chose, and use the pricelist you chose. Add a line with the product: the price will reflect the one added in the product form. Additionally, if they were added, the custom product name and code will also be used in the description of the Sales Order Line.

Note: the customer price defined on the product form will only be used if the correct pricelist is used.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Product prices through this method are only guaranteed on the standard sale
  order workflow. Other custom flows may not reflect the price.
  * Additionally, only custom product prices with no minimum quantity set will be used on the Sales Order
* Custom name and description will be used on Sales Order Lines regardless of pricelist.
