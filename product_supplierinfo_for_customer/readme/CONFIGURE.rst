There's a new section in the *Sales* tab of the product form called "Customers",
where you can define pricelist-like records for customers with the same
structure as the suppliers:

- custom price for a specific customer
- minimum quantity to purchase for this price to apply
- when the price is valid (start and end)
- custom product name and code for a specific customer

There's a new option on pricelist items that allows to get the prices from the
supplierinfo at the product form. These prices will only apply through a pricelist using such rule.
