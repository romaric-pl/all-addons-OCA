To use this module you need to:

#. Go to a customer that you do not want to invoice for incomplete deliveries and check the option ‘Whole Delivered Invoiceability’.
#. Create a sales order and do a partial delivery.

Although it is possible to create an invoice from the order itself, the ‘Create invoice’ button will remain white and the order will not appear in the list of orders to be invoiced, which can be consulted from the ‘To invoice’ menu.
