We recommend you also install the following modules for a better experience:

* account_invoice_prices_update (purchases)
* base_currency_inverse_rate (to see the inverse rate, which is always more familiar to your brain)

Upgrade

If you are upgrading from previous versions, we advise you to delete the UF
and UTM currencies. This way the external reference name will be correctly
established.
