This module extends the functionality of Public Holidays to support States and allow you to define Local Holidays more easily in the Company Calendar.

Shows on Time Off all the holidays (with/without State) in the Public Holidays section.
Public Holidays (without State) always will have grey background.
Local holidays displayed with a grey background in the calendar view belong to the Employee currently viewing the calendar or to the single Employee selected from the Employee Form view.

This module is compatible with Attendances and Contracts (but those modules are not required).
