This module extends the functionality of Public Holidays to support
States and allow you to define Local Holidays more easily in the Company
Calendar.

Shows on Time Off all the holidays (with/without State) in the Public
Holidays section. Public Holidays (without State) always will have grey
background. Local holidays displayed with a grey background in the
calendar view belong to the Employee currently viewing the calendar or
to the single Employee selected from the Employee Form view.

This module is compatible with Attendances and Contracts (but those
modules are not required).

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because in order to differentiate local
Employee holidays, they must be added to their calendars instead of
being able to mark them on the general company calendar.

This will be useful for you if you want to be able to create holidays by
State in the company calendar and have them automatically applied to all
employees based on their workplace.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Time Off app > Configuration > Public Holidays
2. Create a Public Holiday without State with name *Local Holiday*
3. Create an *Employee 1* and set his Work Address in the same State
   than your *Local Holiday*
4. Create an *Employee 2* and set his Work Address in other State than
   your *Local Holiday*
5. Go to Time Off > Overview and check the grey background is only on
   *Employee 1* on the days used in *Local Holiday*
6. Create a Time Off for *Employee 1* that involves *Local Holiday* and
   check the days used are computed correctly
7. Create a Time Off for *Employee 2* that involves *Local Holiday* and
   check the days used are computed correctly (more days than the Time
   Off of *Employee 1*)
8. Check both Employee Calendar views from the Employee form to view the
   grey background on Local and Public Holidays.

If you have installed Attendances and Contracts apps, and create
attenances for both employees on the *Local Holiday* you can also check
Extra Hours are computed correctly in both employees.
