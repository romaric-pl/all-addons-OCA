This module will allow you to integrate an external chat system in your Odoo system.
It requires extra modules with the specific configuration of each chat system, like `mail_gateway_telegram` or `mail_gateway_whatsapp`.

This way, a group of users can respond customers or any other set
of partners within Odoo, but the messages will be sent through the external chat system.
