This module allows you to easily manage deposits : you can select all
the payment lines you received and create a global deposit for the selected
payments lines.
This module supports multi-currency ; each deposit has a currency and all the
lines of the deposit must have the same currency (so, if you have payments in
EUR and payments in USD, you must create 2 deposits: one in EUR and one in USD).
